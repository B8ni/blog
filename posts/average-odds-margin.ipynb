    "Mr. [Joseph Buchdahl](https://twitter.com/12Xpert) shared a smart way to figure out the margin, called [Margin Weights Proportional to the Odds](https://www.football-data.co.uk/The_Wisdom_of_the_Crowd_updated.pdf) (pages 5 - 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever wondered how odds margin actually works? You're spot on, the WOC [^1] strategy by Mr. [Buchdahl](https://twitter.com/12Xpert) works really well with the MPO [^2] method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's put aside Mr. Joseph's strategy and think about this: what's the fairest and most reliable way to calculate the margin? In my opinion, it's considering **all** options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, you may ask? Often, we turn to ensemble models to **minimize variability** while **enhancing consistency**. Rigorously testing diverse methods and **retaining** only **those** with **minimal correlation** can lead us to a **more precise reality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is quite straightforward: **Gather the margins** obtained from these three or less distinct methods and **compute the average odds**. It's a remarkably simple approach that offers valuable insights."
