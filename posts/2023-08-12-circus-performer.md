title: Be Like a Circus Performer
---

Running a startup successfully often requires adopting the mindset of a circus performer.
Imagine everyone coming to watch a show, where the same performer who wows the audience with a somersault is the one who took your ticket and ushered you to your seat.

Being a generalist is often the best approach ****â€” and sometimes, the only road to success**.

If the term ~~generalist~~ doesn't resonate with you, think of yourself as a **versatile circus performer**.

Embrace the idea of **tearing up the ticket**, giving a **stellar performance**, and then **dismantling your equipment**.

Yes, you have to be ready to step outside your comfort zone, and at times, even your passion, if you truly want to excel.

**Now, I'm performing.**
**Buy my ticket.**
